% FILTER_REMOVE_COLOR(VIDEO, MODE) removes the color information of the current
% frame (video.frame(1).filtered). MODE can be either BW (function returns an RGB
% image where only intensity values are considered) or SEPIA ( function returns
% an RGB image transformed into a yellow-brownish image).
%  
%   VIDEO:  a structure containing an array of frames where frame(1)
%   contains the most current frame. 
% 
%   VIDEO = FILTER_REMOVE_COLOR(VIDEO, MODE) returns the original video structure
%   with the updated current video.frame(1).filtered. Each filter takes
%   video.frame(1).filtered as input and writes the result back to this array.
