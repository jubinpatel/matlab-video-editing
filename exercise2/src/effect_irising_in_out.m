% EFFECT_IRISING_IN_OUT(VIDEO, TRANSITION_SIZE, MIN_SIZE, MAX_SIZE, DIST_X,
% DIST_Y, PARAM1, ..) applies an irising in / out effect on a sequence of images.
% PARAMS1 should control the beginning and the duration of the effect.
%  
%   VIDEO:  a structure containing an array of frames where frame(1)
%   contains the most current frame. 
% 
%   FADES: settings for controlling the beginning and the duration of
%   the effect. An array, where the start position is held in {1..N}{1},
%   the duration of the effect is stored in {1..N}{2}. There are 'N' 
%   fade outs/ins.
%
%   VIDEO = EFFECT_IRISING_IN_OUT(VIDEO, TRANSITION_SIZE, MIN_SIZE, MAX_SIZE, DIST_X,
%   DIST_Y, FADES) returns the original video structure with the updated current
%   video.frame(1).filtered.
