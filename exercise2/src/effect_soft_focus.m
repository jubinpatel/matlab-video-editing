% EFFECT_SOFT_FOCUS(VIDEO, BLUR_FACTOR, FOCUS) applies a soft focus
% effect on a sequence of images beginning with START_FRAME. The sequence lasts
% DURATION seconds. The strongest blur filter is applied to the START_FRAME of a sequence and decreases with 
% each following frame. After DURATION frames the blur stops. BLUR_FACTOR
% determines the 'strongness' of the blur at START_FRAME.
%
%   VIDEO:  a structure containing an array of frames where frame(1)
%   contains the most current frame. 
% 
%   BLUR_FACTOR: parameter determines the 'strongness' of the blur at
%   START_FRAME
%
%   FOCUS: contains the start position of each blur and the duration of the blur effect until
%   the blur effect vanishes.
%
%   VIDEO = EFFECT_SOFT_FOCUS(VIDEO, BLUR_FACTOR, FOCUS) returns the original video structure
%   with a blur filter applied to video.frame(X).filtered. A circular averaging filter kernel 
%   (fspecial('disk',..) is used for the blur operation.
